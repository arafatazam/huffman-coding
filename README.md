Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm which uses greedy approach. Please follow this link for knowing more: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms-set-3-huffman-coding/

This project is a part of my Cryptography course.

A live version of the project can be found here: https://repl.it/@arafatazam/Huffman-Coding
